#group meeting : js.js

## About the code

This code is modified from [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/), and I use [SyntexHighlighter](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter) to hightlight the JavaScript Code.

I modified the CSS to fit in the resolution under my MBA (1440*900), and modified the js'js demo page debugging messge output, so it could show on the web.

## About this presentation

This paper is talking about a JavaScript interpreter :JS.JS, which is written in JavaScript. By doing this, a browser can fully control all of the third-party JavaScript running under JS.JS.

JS.JS is designed to fit all the major browsers. However, at this time (Aug, 2012), it could only running under Chrome and Firefox on my MBA (OSX: 10.7.4). 

## About this slides

You can do anything you want, but you should notice that : I usually hide some information in my slides (So I can present those information in the group meeting).
